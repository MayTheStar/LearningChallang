****LearningChallengeğŸ”¥****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**LearningChallenge** is a simple and clean app for tracking learning progress. Users only need to enter their learning goal and the duration of their journey, and they can then monitor it via a calendar. The app includes additional features like **streak** and **freeze**. 

- **StreakğŸ”¥** indicates the consecutive days the user has committed to their set duration, with the streak count increasing accordingly. 
- **FreezeğŸ§Š** allows users to take a break day without losing their streak. While thereâ€™s no limit on the streak count, the freeze feature has a limit.

Both features are represented by numbers, with no cap on the streak but a limited number of freeze days available.
