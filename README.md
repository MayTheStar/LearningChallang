****LearningChallengeðŸ”¥****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**LearningChallenge** is a simple and clean app for tracking learning progress. Users only need to enter their learning goal and the duration of their journey, and they can then monitor it via a calendar. The app includes additional features like **streak** and **freeze**. 

- **StreakðŸ”¥** indicates the consecutive days the user has committed to their set duration, with the streak count increasing accordingly. 
- **FreezeðŸ§Š** allows users to take a break day without losing their streak. While thereâ€™s no limit on the streak count, the freeze feature has a limit.

Both features are represented by numbers, with no cap on the streak but a limited number of freeze days available.

****MVVM****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project demonstrates an implementation of the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architectural pattern. MVVM helps to structure code in a way that separates concerns, enhancing both maintainability and testability.

**Overview**

The application is designed to follow the MVVM pattern to manage and organize code effectively:

**Model:** Contains the data and business logic, responsible for handling and processing data (e.g., fetching from APIs or local databases).

**View:** The user interface layer that displays information to the user and reflects changes from the ViewModel.

**ViewModel:** Acts as the bridge between the Model and the View, formatting data from the Model for display and handling user interactions.
By using MVVM, this project promotes a reactive UI experience, where changes in the data layer automatically update the user interface.


****Key Features****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Data Binding:** Allows automatic UI updates in response to data changes.

**Separation of Concerns:** The ViewModel isolates the View from direct data access, making the code modular and easier to maintain.
